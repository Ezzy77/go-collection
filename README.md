## Overview

go-collection is a comprehensive collection of fundamental data structures implemented in Golang. This project is for learning purposes only, the aim is to understand how commonly used data structures works under the hood, hence, knowing most efficient data structure for certain cases, in addition, polish my unit testing skills.

A suite of unit tests accompanies each data structure implementation, providing comprehensive coverage to ensure correctness and reliability.

## Data Structures

1. [LinkedList](./collection/list/linkedList.go) - A singly linked list implementation.
2. [DoublyLinkedList](./collection/list/doublyLinkedList.go) - A doubly linked list implementation
<!-- 3. [Stack](./stack.go) - A basic stack data structure.
3. [Queue](./queue.go) - An implementation of a queue using slices. -->

## Usage

Provide examples and code snippets demonstrating how to use your implemented data structures. Include information on initialization, insertion, deletion, and any other relevant operations.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/Ezzy77/go-collection"
)

func main() {
	// Example usage of the LinkedList

}

```
